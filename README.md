# String Calculator Kata

My implementation of the popular String Calculator Kata (original description: http://osherove.com/tdd-kata-1) in Ruby and JavaScript up to step 6, which means it does the following:
* sums an unlimited amount of comma separated numbers provided as a string
* allows for custom separators to be defined at the beginning of the string using the format `//[delimiter]\n[your numbers]`
* throws an exception if negative numbers are detected
* filters out numbers larger than 1000

## Instructions

* [Ruby](ruby/README.md)
* [JavaScript](js/README.md)
