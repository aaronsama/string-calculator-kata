## You will need

* Ruby: I suggest installing it via `rbenv` (https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) and not via the package manager of your OS.
* RSpec: `gem install rspec`

## Running from CLI

Launch the CLI script

```
./string_calculator_cli.rb
# or
ruby string_calculator_cli.rb
```

The input is read from STDIN. Use CTRL+D (on Unix systems) to terminate input with an EOF.

## Testing

After installing RSpec just type `rspec`.

The tests are organized in steps that correspond to steps 1-6 of the kata.
